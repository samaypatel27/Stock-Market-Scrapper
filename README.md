**STOCK MARKET SCRAPPER**

This was a project during my time as a High School Intern at Worthington Steel headquartered in Columbus, OH.

I would like to thank Joshua Lyday, my mentor during the time of my internship, for teaching me the skills nessecary for completing this project
and inspiring me further.

The main file is in .XAML, but it was converted by GitHub from the code I built in UiPath, a framework used to build efficent Robotic Process Automation (RPA) proccesses.
