**STOCK MARKET SCRAPPER**

This was a project during my time as a High School Intern at Worthington Steel headquartered in Columbus, OH.

I would like to thank Joshua Lyday, my mentor during the time of my internship, for teaching me the skills nessecary for completing this project
and inspiring me further.

The main file is in .XAML, but it was converted by GitHub from the code I built in UiPath, a framework used to build efficent Robotic Process Automation (RPA) proccesses.

This project takes the input one or multiple excel files, with a list of stocks on each row. Then, the program creates a seperate page for each stock, scrapping information from the web
such as open, close price, market yield, a picture of the graph, ect. Then, it takes a list of the top 500 stocks listed by NASDAQ and organizes information by daily % change.

The excel sheet used to store this information is copied from a "template" file. The program also automatically recycles/deletes other files from previous debugs, upon each run.
